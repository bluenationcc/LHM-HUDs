# LHM-HUDs
There is experimental live HUD style switching available with this HUD in its settings. It currently only does color palette changes, but the plan is to support even some basic placement changes down the line.

# Development
All the PRs are encouraged. There is no level of support provided for the code you see. It's technically under WTFPL or The Unlicense, but since I have to adhere to upstream license, I'm going to say it's under the same license as the upstream HUD (CS:GO react HUD by Team Lexogrine).
